# MapTheAccused - Fraud Case Visualization System

## Project Overview
MapTheAccused is a comprehensive web application designed to visualize accused individuals involved in fraud or cybercrime cases. The system provides search functionality by phone number, name, or address, and displays their locations on interactive maps.

## Original User Problem Statement
Build a web application to visualize accused individuals involved in fraud or cybercrime cases, searchable by phone number, name, or address. When a user searches, the app should show the accused's details if available and highlight their location on Google Maps (via MyMaps or Google Maps embed).

## Getting Started

### Default Login Credentials
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: SuperAdmin (full access)

### First Time Setup
1. Login with default credentials
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Click "Seed Sample Data" to populate with Indian fraud cases
4. Explore search functionality and map visualization

## Bug Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ "Invalid Host header" Error Resolution
**Issue**: React webpack-dev-server was blocking requests with unrecognized host headers in the Kubernetes environment.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Updated `package.json` start script: `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true react-scripts start`
2. Added `DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true` to frontend `.env` file
3. Restarted frontend service

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Application now loads correctly without host header errors

- Always test API endpoints in logical order (auth ‚Üí CRUD ‚Üí search)
- Include role-based permission testing
- Test OpenCage geocoding with Indian addresses
- Verify data validation and error handling

### For Frontend Testing (`auto_frontend_testing_agent`)
- Test responsive design and user interactions
- Verify map functionality and marker interactions  
- Test search functionality with various inputs
- Validate role-based access and navigation

### Data Consistency
- Always use Indian addresses for geocoding tests
- Use proper Indian phone number formats
